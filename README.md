# Drag-n-Drop Recipe Builder

** Upcoming tutorial **

A drag-n-drop powered recipe builder that uses AJAX to pull combinations from a database. Pretty much mirror's the mechanics behind the popular Doodle God game.

## Getting Started

Since this is a preliminary build, you'll have to do a little more legwork to get it up and running. Run the install.php script after plugging in your database info to get started. You can use the `add-recipe.php` script to add recipes. Only two ingredients ("Water Bottle" and "Newspaper") are included to start.

The `recipes-builder.php` file loads the builder itself. Results will show up once you've plugged in some recipes to the database.
